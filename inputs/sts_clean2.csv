STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You should check the conditions of your journal using the SHERPA/RoMEO list.	You should read the copyright transfer contract that you have signed.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It is not completely true that failures are not published.	One of the consequences of not reporting failures is publication bias.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Citing online articles without a clear author depends on the citation format.	There are probably several answers depending on the situation and on the standards in your field.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		http://www.higheredjobs.com They have jobs broken down by Job Category, Region, and Institution Type.	At this point I am a broken record: this is one of the situations I found myself in.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Receiving an invitation to help out at a NSF or NIH study session is highly unlikely and logistically difficult.	Reviewing grant proposals as a student is tricky, at least in some fields.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It might be worth mentioning this while you are applying for PhD positions.	If the award is sufficiently prestigious then you should list it, otherwise you should not.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		So far, I think this is better to make a rotation of the instructor.	Aside from having common exams, one possibility is to withhold the names of the instructors until the registration is finished.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Yes, high-profile journals do typically edit figures for style and consistency.	As grauwulf comments, your job is to focus on the content.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I have been using a mode for Emacs called Org-mode to track my research and do project planning.	I highly recommend Wunderkit (recently released) and Wunderlist for organizing to-do list, and taking notes.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		To add to other answers: How often one publishes in the most prestigious general journals (e.g.	Another thing is (in conjunction with the number of publications) the number of coauthors, i.e.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.60	This post refers to research in the STEM fields, and may not be applicable to other research topics.	This is about my experience in computer engineering I found that reading for breadth was the more important approach.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think your method (thesis title in the education section) is the standard one.	Some people publish their theses as part of a monograph series.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think it really depends on how long you plan to work without salary.	Why not just bring up the idea of staying in your current lab with your advisor?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I know that TikZ was mentioned already, but I think it deserve its own answer.	Mathematica is actually good for making all sorts of graphics.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		plain text/markup language For mathematics, I think TeX/LaTeX is the way to go.	binary/plain text Other things to consider (for the future) is the movement towards standard meta-data items contained with the research articles (e.g.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.00	My answer would be depending on which GRE are you referring to?	The problem I see with the GREs is that the scoring range is highly compressed.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You could ask members of your doctoral committee to write you a letter of recommendation each.	You need to strategize with your advisor, or a trusted mentor, about this.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You should do what makes you happy and you find interesting.	You can definitely apply in a different field than your undergraduate.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I did this in the earlier stages of my career, when every little bit of CV weight helped.	On the one hand, it shows that you are engaged in this necessary part of scientific research that is peer-review.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		A strong factor for most people will be the financial impact, i.e.	I applied to six graduate schools in my field, and was accepted at all of them.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I would allow rescheduling, but be sure to use a different exam.	In my school, redo exams have a maximum grade of the minimum grade to pass.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		For everything that have been reviewed AND permanently archived then the bibliography is fine.	The best practice is to include standard bibliographic information, a relatively stable hypertext link for current readers (e.g.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Many universities have a unit devoted to providing support with grant applications.	If you are writing proposals for NSF consider volunteering as a reviewer in your discipline.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I agree with the other answer that this is a normal occurrence.	Depending on which country you are talking about, there may be league tables for the universities in that country.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.60	It is perfectly okay to ask for the figure knowing well that the other person may not give.	You can always ask, then it is the choice of the author to accept or not.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In my very personal opinion MDPI is an reputable publisher, but their journals are not first-class.	The peer review process generally differs between predatory and non predatory journals.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		As you do more things, you can become more selective with what you list.	First of all: note that there is a difference between an academic CV and a resume.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.20	The academic year does start around September in the USA and I think most European countries.	I would not accelerate things, to avoid getting worse grades that you want.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		http://www.glassdoor.com/ works by getting anonymous information from users and sharing it.	I think this page has what you are looking for.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		For presentations, when you are using graphics from other papers, you refer to the paper.	There are two parts to this question: citation and copyright issues.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Remember that Europe is a big place, comprised of lots of different countries.	There are tough (read respectable) and relatively easy (read weaker) schools and PhD programs in both sides.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Applying to Masters Program does not really depend on one single factor but a variety of factors.	Yes, the acknowledgements section of your paper is an appropriate place to thank anyone who provided valuable assistance.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This recent Nature news item would seem to suggest rather strongly that SCIRP is not a serious outfit.	Yes, I do indeed have some direct experience with them.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I checked the peer review policy of Nature and Science, I guess that should is the best we can get.	Well, as you said, there is no rule that explicitly says that the information mentioned in a “invitation to review” is confidential.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.00	Edit, again: The question seems to have changed, yet again.	I can think of three reasons why a faculty member might reveal how a student performed on a qualifying examination.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		True story: a bottle of wine (well, maybe just half a bottle).	Second, I try to process 10 or so exams before actually marking any of them.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Script only the introduction I can only echo what Artem said about the disadvantages of a script.	I think a script is actually more harmful than good.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think the answer to your question is very dependent on your subject and the culture of that research area.	I agree that reference formatting for a thesis tends to follow university and discipline specific guidelines.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I would say that it depends on the complexity you get out of it.	You should definitely consider publishing the algorithm, but not before you could say something more than merely a pseudocode.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		When asking a question, it is desirable to explicitly establish a non-confrontational tone.	My personal preference is not to offer a compliment in this setting.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !	For questions 1 and 2: it depends: you have to find out from your individual advisor/department/university.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.00	This does not fully answer your question, but it is certainly one consideration.	I am a PhD student in Computational Science, which is an interdisciplinary major spanning mathematics, computer science, and engineerning.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		TV-L is the German public servant remuneration grade table (Tarifvertrag für den Öffentlichen Dienst der Länder (TV-L)).	I am sure a psychologist could provide an indepth analysis to a large part of this question.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		nobody cares about your university, the only important thing at least in Europe is your CV.	Does doing a postdoc mean a commitment to an academic career?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.40	A few possible problems: 1) Such an ID system seems a little intrusive.	In mathematics, we already have a database of this sort - two them, in fact, with in MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Short answer: The full name is Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Tekhnicheskaya Kibernetika.	As others have said, not every (old) article has a DOI or a URL.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In your case, how do you find 14 good leaders from 70 students?	My armchair researching dug up a lot of articles about this.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.40	As an complement to the other answers, let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking.	The other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Of course the apparent relative sizes of the sun and moon are coincidental.	As a matter of fact, yes, it is only a coincidence.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Two things need to be considered here: focusing speed and adequate sensitivity to light to achieve a fast shutter speed.	Often a faster lens will be sharper even at the same aperture as a cheaper lens.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think this is an example of: use the opportunities you have, rather than the ones you wish you had.	Polarizers and neutral density filters will go a long way to help this, but they are not a panacea.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I upgraded from 400D to 7D and things just got sharper (and you should expect the same).	It has to do with the sensor size - large sensors require correspondingly larger lenses.
